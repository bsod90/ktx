# ktx
Ktx is a lightweight terminal-ui utility for editing the kubectl config

If you work with a large infrastructure where you have to jump between clusters a lot, ktx may make your life a little bit easier by helping you to:
- quickly search and switch contexts in your ~/.kube/config
- test and remove stale contexts
- discover GKE/EKS/AKS clusters and quickly import credentials
